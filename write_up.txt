Bug fixes for Task 2:
    #Bug: status is a string, but function is_error_status() compares it numerically


Explanation of attack detection script: 
    High Request Rate

        The script tracks how many requests each IP address makes within a rolling 1-minute window.
        If an IP makes more than 100 requests in a minute, it is considered suspicious and flagged.

    High Error Rate

        The script counts total and error responses (HTTP status codes from 400 to 599) per IP.
        If an IP has made at least 20 requests, and more than 50% of those are errors, it is flagged for potentially malicious behavior (e.g., probing non-existent endpoints or brute-force attempts).

    Accessing Suspicious Endpoints

        A list of common admin or sensitive endpoints (/admin, /login,) is monitored.
        If an IP accesses these more than 10 times, it may indicate unauthorized access attempts and is flagged accordingly.
